# Project-Trova 🌍

**Trova** is a full-stack web and mobile application built for travel lovers. It serves as a unified platform where travelers can share their adventures and easily rent camping or travel-related gear from verified sellers — all in one place.

---

## ✨ Purpose

Currently, there is no single platform that allows travelers to both share their experiences and rent travel gear. **Trova** was developed to fill this gap. 

Travelers often prefer renting items like tents, backpacks, and other camping essentials instead of purchasing them — it's cost-effective and sustainable. **Trova** aims to support this culture while also fostering a vibrant community where travelers can exchange experiences, tips, and stories.

- **Normal Users**:  
  Can explore travel content, share travel-related posts, and rent items from sellers.
